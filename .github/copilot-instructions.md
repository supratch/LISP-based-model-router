# AI Workload Routing System - Copilot Instructions

This project implements a comprehensive AI workload routing system with LISP and DNS-based routing capabilities for enterprise environments.

## Project Overview
- **Backend**: Python Flask/FastAPI for routing logic
- **Frontend**: React-based WebUI for monitoring and management
- **Routing**: LISP and DNS-based intelligent routing
- **AI Models**: Support for multiple LLM models with intelligent routing
- **Enterprise**: Designed for production enterprise environments

## Architecture Components
1. LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol) routing engine
2. DNS-based load balancing and service discovery
3. AI workload classifier and router
4. Multiple LLM model integration
5. Web-based monitoring and management interface
6. Enterprise security and logging features

## Development Guidelines
- Follow enterprise security best practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use type hints for Python code
- Follow React best practices for UI components
- Ensure scalability and performance optimization
- Include comprehensive testing
